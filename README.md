# Description

This app allows the user to have a WorkDay Calendar. The user can add different appointments, meetings that are stored in local storage. The user can refresh the page and the data will still be there. The user can also update the time slots with new information. 

The time slots change color dynamically depending on whether the time is in the future, past or if it's the current time. This app uses MomentJs which allows the user to see the current date and time.

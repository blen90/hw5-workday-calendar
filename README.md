## My task

My task for this homework was to work on a Work Day Scheduler. An HTML and a CSS file was provided to me and I needed to work on the JavaScript file by using jQuery, Bootstrap and Moment JS. 

The criteria to meet for this homework was the following:
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

```
